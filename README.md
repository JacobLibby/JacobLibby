### Hello All!
  My name is Jacob Libby and I recently worked at N1 Health as an Associate Data Ops Engineer. I am hoping to spend more time working on passion projects and expanding my knowledge in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, and Full-stack Development.

 - Pronouns: he/him/his
 - Iâ€™m currently ðŸŒ± learning Ruby & React and am planning a D&D campaign, ðŸ¤¿ diving deeper into creating a Python course, and ðŸš¶exploring radio technology and performing data analyses in my free time
 - âš¡Fun Facts (about the world and Jacob) âš¡:
<ol>
  <li>The "O" and "|" on electrical devices actually denote 0 (off) and 1 (on) in binary</li>
  <li>The first computer bug was a moth</li>
  <li>I still have some days that I need to be reconvinced about the Monty Hall Problem</li>
  <li>The fact that the vital technologies of today (wi-fi, radio, bluetooth) are all just waves of different lengths and magnitudes is extraordinary to me. BONUS: use an oscilloscope to analyze data being transfered between devices (Arduinos are pretty easy to use) and <b>YOU CAN SEE THE ONES AND ZEROS OF THE BINARY DATA BEING TRANSMITTED!!!</b> It's honestly life-changing to watch. </li>
  </ol>
